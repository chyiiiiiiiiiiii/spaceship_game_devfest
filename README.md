# 亲子AI编程星际之旅

This project is the topic for DevFest Shanghai 2023. Talk about the game component and let the attendees implement some features. Enjoy the game development.

I put the project in Zapp online IDE. It helps us to share the project to everyone. Start in the seconds without environment setup.
